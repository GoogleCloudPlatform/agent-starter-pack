# Agent Templates

The Agent Starter Pack provides several production-ready agent templates to accelerate your development.

## Available Templates

| Agent Name | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `adk_base` | A base ReAct agent implemented using Google's [Agent Development Kit](https://github.com/google/adk-python) | General purpose conversational agent |
| `agentic_rag` | A RAG agent for document retrieval and Q&A | Document search and question answering |
| `langgraph_base_react` | A base ReAct agent using LangGraph | General purpose agent with reasoning capabilities |
| `crewai_coding_crew` | A multi-agent system implemented with CrewAI | Collaborative coding assistance |
| `live_api` | A real-time multimodal RAG agent | Audio/video/text chat with knowledge base |

## Choosing the Right Template

When selecting a template, consider:

1. **Use Case**: What problem are you trying to solve?
2. **Framework Preference**: Do you prefer ADK, LangGraph, or CrewAI?
3. **Complexity**: How complex is your agent's reasoning process?
4. **Multimodal Needs**: Do you need to handle audio, video, or just text?

- Document chunking and embedding
- Contextual question answering

### LangGraph Base ReAct

This template implements a ReAct agent using LangGraph, providing:

- Structured reasoning capabilities
- Flexible agent workflows
- Tool integration

### CrewAI Coding Crew

The CrewAI Coding Crew template demonstrates a multi-agent system for coding tasks:

- Senior Engineer agent for code generation
- QA Engineer agent for code review
- Collaborative problem-solving

### Live API

The Live API template offers a multimodal experience:

- Real-time audio/video/text chat
- Vector database integration
- Responsive UI

## Customizing Templates

All templates are designed to be customized. To modify a template:

1. Create a new agent from the template
2. Explore the code structure
3. Modify the agent logic, tools, or UI as needed

For more details on customization, see the [Customization Guide](../guide/customization.md).
